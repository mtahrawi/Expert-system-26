    "The system selects the most appropriate communication medium based on given message characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the nature of rule-based expert systems, multiple rules may be triggered at the same time.\n",

    "\n",
    "A conflict occurs when multiple rules are applicable for the same set of facts.\n",

    "- stimulus_situation = visual\n",
    "- stimulus_response = oral\n",
    "- feedback = required\n",

    "- Lecture / Tutorial\n",
    "- Role-play Exercises\n",

    "\n",
    "The system resolves conflicts using a Priority-Based Conflict Resolution Mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each rule is assigned a priority value using the salience attribute provided by the Experta framework.\n",

    "## System Implementation\n",

    "The conflict resolution mechanism is implemented by assigning different salience values to conflicting rules.\n",
    "The following code demonstrates how conflicts are created and resolved using rule priority.\n"

# Media Advisor Expert System with Conflict Resolution

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Rule-Based Media Advisor Expert System** designed to recommend the most appropriate communication media based on message characteristics.

A key challenge addressed in this system is **rule conflict**, which occurs when multiple rules are triggered simultaneously and suggest different media options.  
To handle this, a **Conflict Resolution Mechanism** is implemented using expert system strategies.

## 🎯 Conflict Scenario

A conflict occurs when the message has the following characteristics:

- Urgent
- Sensitive
- Intended for a large audience

In this case, multiple rules are activated, each recommending a different media channel such as:
- SMS
- Social Media
- Email
- Direct Phone Call
This situation requires a conflict resolution strategy to choose the most appropriate recommendation.

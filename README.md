# Expert-system-26 
This repository is dedicated only to my students enrolled in DSAI 3302 in 2026!
Question:
You are tasked with designing a Conflict Resolution Mechanism for a
Media Advisor Expert System.
git@github.com:mtahrawi/Expert-systems-26.git
Tasks:
Define a scenario where conflicting rules might arise.
Propose a Conflict Resolution Mechanism for the given scenario. Your
solution should:
1 Describe the method(s) used to resolve the conflict (e.g., priority,
recency, specificity).
2 Include an explanation of why your chosen method is appropriate.
3 Create a sample set of rules and demonstrate how your mechanism
resolves conflicts between them.
Upgrading your mechanism using the attached python work

This project implements a conflict resolution mechanism for the Media Advisor
rule-based expert system using Experta.

## Key Idea
When multiple rules are activated at the same time, the system generates
candidate media recommendations and selects only one final medium using:
- Priority
- Specificity
- Recency (timestamp)

## How to Run
Install experta and run the Python file.
